Policy parameters
=================

This section contains documentation of policy parameters in a format that is
easy to search and print.
The policy parameters are grouped here as they are are in the
[Tax-Brain webapp](https://www.compute.studio/PSLmodels/Tax-Brain/).
Parameters understood by Tax-Calculator and the `tc` CLI,
but not available on Tax-Brain,
are placed in an Other Parameters group at the end of the section.
