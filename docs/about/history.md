## Functions of Taxcalc-Payroll

Taxcalc-Payroll is a payroll tax model, consisted of (1) payroll tax functions  (2) employer side payroll tax offset function 

## Origins of Taxcalc-Payroll

Taxcalc-Payroll orginiats from [Tax-Calculator](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator). 

In the past, Tax-Calculator was the only microsimulation model for both income tax analysis and payroll tax analysis. 

However, in the progess of model expansion, many payroll tax featured developments are newly made (for example, employer side payroll tax offset function). These developments are beyond the realm of Tax-Calculator. It has become necessary to build Taxcalc-Payroll as a new platform to host them. 

From the perspective of model management, many research organizations also build their tax model systems consisted of an income tax model and payroll tax model. It is thus considered better to have Tax-Calculator and Taxcalc-Payroll seperately serveing as income tax calculator and payroll tax calculator.

Taxcalc-Payroll inherits the software infrastructure from Tax-Calculator. These two models are highly integrated, with most tax calaulation functions can be called by each other. Users can still conduct both income and payroll tax analysis from one either model.
